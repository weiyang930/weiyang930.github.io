My name is Wei Yang. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the Viterbi School of Engineering, University of Southern California (USC), under the guidance of Prof. Jesse Thomason.

## 🔬 Research Interests

My research interests primarily lie in **Agentic LLMs**, **Efficient Multi-Agent LLM Systems**, **Multi-Agent RL**, and **Generative & Multimodal Recommendation**:

### 🤖 Agentic LLM Systems

- **Theory-of-Mind Multi-Agent Reasoning**
- **Meta-Deliberation & Collective Intelligence**
- **Coordination Protocols & Role Specialization**
- **Tree-Structured Judgement & Multi-Agent Verification**

### ⚡ Efficient Multi-Agent LLM Systems

- **Cost-Aware Collaboration & Budgeted Decision Making**
- **Communication-Efficient Orchestration**
- **Multi-Agent Reasoning Compression (CoT Distillation)**
- **Robust MARL & Credit Assignment**

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
