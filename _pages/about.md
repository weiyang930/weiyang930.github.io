My name is Wei Yang. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the [Viterbi School of Engineering](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/), University of Southern California (USC), under the guidance of Prof. [Jesse Thomason](https://jessethomason.com/). I am a member of the [GLAMOR Lab](https://glamor-usc.github.io/). I received my B.S. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
